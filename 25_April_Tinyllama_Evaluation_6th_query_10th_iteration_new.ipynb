Simple sugars are made up of monosaccharides, such as glucose and fructose. Complex sugars, on the other hand, consist of two types of monosaccharides: glycogen and lactose.\\nCarbohydrates can be classified based on their molecular structure. Simple sugars are classified based on their structure. Glucose is a simple, unbranched sugar with a molecular mass of approximately 180. Lactic acid, on the other hand, is a complex, multifunctional compound. Lactic acid consists of two monosaccharides: glucose and fructose.\\nCarbohydrates are classified based on their molecular structure. Carbohydrates are classified based on their molecular structure, and they can be classified based on their structure.
