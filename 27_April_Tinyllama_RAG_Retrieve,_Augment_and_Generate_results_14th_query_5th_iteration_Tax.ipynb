Tax compliance issue is a major problem in revenue generation by the government in Nepal. This  study therefore aims to examine the impact of tax knowledge and awareness,  detection and  punishment, tax system and implementation, attitudes towards tax, tax rewards and incentives, and  tax policy on tax compliance behavior of small-sized enterprises of Pokhara Valley. The study is  based on descriptive and analytical research design with a quantitative nature of data. Required  data were collected through primary sources by using a self-administered questionnaire, coded, and  analyzed by employing both descriptive and inferential statistics namely mean, standard deviation,  Pearson’s correlation, and multiple linear regression models side by side 50 samples were selected  along with a convenience sampling design. The study result confirms that the variables including  tax knowledge and awareness, tax system and implementation, detection and punishment, and tax  policy display low positive relationships with tax compliance behaviour but attitudes toward tax  show a negative correlation. Besides this, the relationship between tax rewards and incentives and  tax compliance behaviour is moderate. Additionally, all the explanatory variables have an  insignificant impact on the tax compliance of the small-sized businesses of Pokhara Valley. It is  anticipated that this study will offer significant new information and comprehension to academics,  practitioners, policymakers, and other regulatory bodies involved in the creation of tax policies.   Keywords : Tax Knowledge, Tax Policy, Tax System, Punishment, Tax Compliance    INTRODUCTION  All kinds of government including  national, provincial, or local, depend  mostly on taxes for funding. The  government must impose taxes on  people,  companies,  or  other  organizations to generate funds for public  use. Government operations and the  supply of public goods and services,  including  infrastructure,  healthcare,  education, and national defense, depend  on taxes. Taxes are used to affect  economic behavior, redistribute wealth,  fulfill  government  debts,  provide  commodities  for  residents,  and  accomplish social policy objectives in  addition to their core purpose of raising  money  for  public  spending  and  government operations (IslaM, 2016).  Taxes are a type of payment that  individuals, organizations, or businesses  operating under government control must  make  to  support the  government.  Taxation starts at birth and concludes  with a person's death. When someone is  born, they must pay the birth tax.\"},\n",

Business organizations want to  minimize costs to maximize profit. There  are two alternatives to maximize profit  i.e. either to increase sales price or to  decrease expenses. The first one is a  danger because it decreases demand and  ultimately reduces revenue. Therefore,  the organizations need to manage  expenses to maximize profit and hence  they intend to pay less tax but the  government’s main source of revenue is  tax. Therefore, the goals of the state to  increase tax income and the citizenry to  reduce tax incidence are at odds with one  another. The existence of a contemporary  tax system with certain technological  advancements may occasionally be  insufficient to resolve this dispute (Nerre  2008). How well organized both tax  legislation and tax administration are not  sufficient, since human factors become  more important than their organization  (Mutlu & Tasci 2013).    According to James and Alley (2004), tax  compliance is the readiness of people and  other taxable entities to behave in a way  that complies with the language and spirit  of tax legislation and administration  without resorting to enforcement action.  Any economy needs tax compliance to  guarantee that the government receives  the funds necessary to provide public  services and promote economic growth.  The extent to which a taxpayer complies  with tax laws and regulations is referred  to as tax compliance. Three categories of  compliance  are  distinguished  by  McBarnett  (2003),  innovative,  capitulative, and committed compliance.  Committed compliance is the readiness  of a taxpayer to carry out their tax  obligations  without  complaint.  Capitulation compliance is the inability  of a taxpayer to comply with their tax  obligations, whereas creative compliance  refers to any effort made by a taxpayer to  reduce taxes by redefining income and  deductible costs within the parameters of  the law. Tax compliance is one of the  policymaker's attention factors, under  which demographic factors are most  important on tax compliance (Alabede,  2014).  According  to  Kirchler  (2007),  Compliance might be required or  Voluntary. Voluntary compliance is  made  possible  by  the  taxpayer's  commitment to voluntarily follow the  guidelines and directives of the tax  authority as well as the mutual trust and  cooperation that grow between the two  parties. However, in cases where there is  a hostile tax environment—that is, where  there is mistrust and a lack of  collaboration between the authorities and  the taxpayer—they have the power to  enforce  compliance.  To  enforce  compliance, taxpayers who fail to pay  their taxes may face an audit and a fine.  In an earlier review of 43 tax compliance  studies conducted between 1974 and  1985, Jackson and Milliron (1986)  identified fourteen key variables of  compliance behaviour: age, gender,  education, income level, income source,  occupation,  peer  influence,  ethics,  fairness, complexity, contact with tax  authorities, sanctions, the likelihood of  detection, and tax rates. The relationship  between fines and tax compliance shows  inconsistent findings (Fischer et al.,  1992).  According to Alm and Gomez (2008)  research, there is a significant positive  relationship  between  taxpayers'  perceptions of the advantages of political  goods and their willingness to abide by  tax laws. Attitudes represent the positive\"}]"

According  to Sardjono (2013), taxpayers' desire to  pay depends on their comprehension of  tax laws and their positive opinion of the  tax system's efficacy.     Zeng (2014) discovered that the most  significant  factor  influencing  the  participants' tax compliance behaviour  was the tax law system. A study's  findings indicate that a wide variety of  factors, including the personal traits of  taxpayers,  the  tax  system,  tax  administration, and the state of the  economy and politics, have an impact on  tax compliance. The main issues of  nontax compliance are taxpayers facing  high tax rates, citizens' tax attitude and  low tax morale, incorrect tax payment,  unsuitable public spending concerning  taxpayer preferences, disbelief in the  existence, noncompliance of taxpayers  due to unfriendly state-citizen relations,  poor structure of the tax system & tax  administration that doesn’t meet the  expectations & needs of taxpayers,  noncompliance of taxpayers due to  economic & political structures, low  level of governmental accountability and  transparency (Helhel & Ahmed, 2014).  Tax knowledge does not affect tax  compliance; therefore, efforts should be  made to raise taxpayer awareness to  increase  tax  compliance  and,  consequently, increase the amount of  money collected by the government  (Fauziati, et al., 2020). Tax complexity  and tax knowledge are considered to be  contributing factors to taxpayers' non- compliance behaviour (Saad, 2014).   One important factor that has been found  to influence tax compliance behavior is  the attitude of taxpayers. Numerous  economic  research  studies  have  demonstrated that tax compliance is  dependent on individual decisions about  paying taxes or evading them. These  studies have also confirmed that a large  number of potential determinants of  voluntary compliance, such as social  norms, equity and fairness, perceptions  of politics and the government, and  accountability towards tax compliance  attitude, can have an impact on an  individual's  income  or  profit  (Jayawardane, 2015). According to  Kamil (2015), a taxpayer's awareness,  knowledge, tax penalties, and tax  services have a big impact on how  compliant they  are  as  a  person.  According to Sinnasamy et al. (2015),  peer pressure controlled by tax agents,  tax rates, penalties, and tax fairness might  all lead to higher tax compliance in  Malaysia. In a study, Onu (2016)  examined the methods used to measure  attitudes in tax surveys and evaluated the  data that has been collected to date to  establish a connection between these  measures of attitude and real compliance.  The  study  makes  numerous  recommendations for enhancing the  specificity of attitude measurements,  using assessment scales, and reducing  social desirability biases to increase their  predictive usefulness. For the benefit of  academics preparing to perform survey  work, several guidelines are provided  about how to measure attitudes and  interpret attitude surveys. Additionally,  the results of taxpayer surveys may be  utilized to inform the creation and  management of tax laws.  According to Kiow (2017), public  governance and openness in government  operations have an impact on individuals'  ethical perceptions, which in turn have an  impact  on  their  tax  compliance  behaviour.

Tax compliance issue is a major problem in revenue generation by the government in Nepal. This  study therefore aims to examine the impact of tax knowledge and awareness,  detection and  punishment, tax system and implementation, attitudes towards tax, tax rewards and incentives, and  tax policy on tax compliance behavior of small-sized enterprises of Pokhara Valley. The study is  based on descriptive and analytical research design with a quantitative nature of data. Required  data were collected through primary sources by using a self-administered questionnaire, coded, and  analyzed by employing both descriptive and inferential statistics namely mean, standard deviation,  Pearson’s correlation, and multiple linear regression models side by side 50 samples were selected  along with a convenience sampling design. The study result confirms that the variables including  tax knowledge and awareness, tax system and implementation, detection and punishment, and tax  policy display low positive relationships with tax compliance behaviour but attitudes toward tax  show a negative correlation. Besides this, the relationship between tax rewards and incentives and  tax compliance behaviour is moderate. Additionally, all the explanatory variables have an  insignificant impact on the tax compliance of the small-sized businesses of Pokhara Valley. It is  anticipated that this study will offer significant new information and comprehension to academics,  practitioners, policymakers, and other regulatory bodies involved in the creation of tax policies.

Each has a different  ethical viewpoint, which is shaped by  their experiences interacting with the  government as well as changes in their  environment.  Their  compliance  behaviour  may  be  influenced  by  perceptions of how taxpayers\\' money is  being used, the advantages they receive  from the government, or the knowledge  that others avoid paying taxes. If the  government uses tax revenue responsibly  or provides advantages to taxpayers in  the form of public goods and social  comforts, then taxpayer compliance will  increase. According to Rahayu (2017), a  society\\'s awareness and comprehension  of tax laws will boost government tax  income. The study demonstrated the  substantial direct impact that taxpayer  awareness  and  knowledge  of  tax  regulations,  used  alone  and  in  combination, have on tax compliance.  Even though respondents\\' levels of tax  knowledge varied widely, Poudel (2017)  found that tax knowledge had a  substantial influence. His findings are  supported by this investigation. The  study\\'s findings are consistent with those  of Sinnasamy et al. (2015), who  concluded that peer pressure controlled  by tax agents, tax rates, penalties, and tax  fairness might all boost tax compliance in  Malaysia. According to Rahayu (2017), a  society\\'s awareness and comprehension  of tax laws will boost government tax  income. This study also shows the  substantial direct impact that taxpayer  awareness  and  knowledge  of  tax  regulations, both alone and together,  have on tax compliance.    Deyganto  (2018)  found  that  tax  compliance  is  not  significantly  influenced by the taxpayer\\'s education  level or the competence of the tax  authority, but rather by factors such as  gender, age, lack of tax knowledge,  simplicity of the tax system, awareness of  the penalty for tax evasion, taxpayer  income level, and perception of tax rates.  These factors are significantly correlated  with a voluntary compliance attitude.  Ghimire  (2019)  concluded  that  individual  taxpayer  compliance  behaviour is significantly positively  correlated with tax knowledge, tax  system, and tax fairness. Tiwari (2021),  found that there is a favourable  correlation between tax compliance and  government incentives, peer influence,  tax awareness, and tax attitudes. The  study\\'s conclusions show that key factors  influencing rental taxpayers\\' compliance  behaviour are their awareness of and  perception of taxes. It is more important  to raise taxpayer knowledge, provide  incentives from the government, and  cultivate a favourable tax attitude than  imposing fines on the taxpayers. The cost  of non-compliance or the imposition of  fines is negatively correlated with  taxpayer compliance.  In this research, true reporting of the tax  base, correct computation of the liability,  timely filing of the return, and timely  payment of the amounts due are  considered  tax  compliance.  The  readiness of individuals to behave  following the \"spirit\" and the \"letter\" of  the tax law and administration without  the use of enforcement activities is  referred to as tax compliance, according  to James and Alley (2002). Before then,  tax compliance was described by Roth et  al. (1989) as appropriately reporting tax  liabilities on necessary tax returns  submitted in line with the tax legislation  in effect at the time the return is filed. The  main objective of this paper is to examine  the factors influencing tax compliance of  small business enterprises in Pokhara  Valley.  The study tested the following'),\n",

Business organizations want to  minimize costs to maximize profit. There  are two alternatives to maximize profit  i.e. either to increase sales price or to  decrease expenses. The first one is a  danger because it decreases demand and  ultimately reduces revenue. Therefore,  the organizations need to manage  expenses to maximize profit and hence  they intend to pay less tax but the  government’s main source of revenue is  tax. Therefore, the goals of the state to  increase tax income and the citizenry to  reduce tax incidence are at odds with one  another. The existence of a contemporary  tax system with certain technological  advancements may occasionally be  insufficient to resolve this dispute (Nerre  2008). How well organized both tax  legislation and tax administration are not  sufficient, since human factors become  more important than their organization  (Mutlu & Tasci 2013).    According to James and Alley (2004), tax  compliance is the readiness of people and  other taxable entities to behave in a way  that complies with the language and spirit  of tax legislation and administration  without resorting to enforcement action.  Any economy needs tax compliance to  guarantee that the government receives  the funds necessary to provide public  services and promote economic growth.  The extent to which a taxpayer complies  with tax laws and regulations is referred  to as tax compliance. Three categories of  compliance  are  distinguished  by  McBarnett  (2003),  innovative,  capitulative, and committed compliance.  Committed compliance is the readiness  of a taxpayer to carry out their tax  obligations  without  complaint.  Capitulation compliance is the inability  of a taxpayer to comply with their tax  obligations, whereas creative compliance  refers to any effort made by a taxpayer to  reduce taxes by redefining income and  deductible costs within the parameters of  the law. Tax compliance is one of the  policymaker's attention factors, under  which demographic factors are most  important on tax compliance (Alabede,  2014).  According  to  Kirchler  (2007),  Compliance might be required or  Voluntary. Voluntary compliance is  made  possible  by  the  taxpayer's  commitment to voluntarily follow the  guidelines and directives of the tax  authority as well as the mutual trust and  cooperation that grow between the two  parties. However, in cases where there is  a hostile tax environment—that is, where  there is mistrust and a lack of  collaboration between the authorities and  the taxpayer—they have the power to  enforce  compliance.  To  enforce  compliance, taxpayers who fail to pay  their taxes may face an audit and a fine.  In an earlier review of 43 tax compliance  studies conducted between 1974 and  1985, Jackson and Milliron (1986)  identified fourteen key variables of  compliance behaviour: age, gender,  education, income level, income source,  occupation,  peer  influence,  ethics,  fairness, complexity, contact with tax  authorities, sanctions, the likelihood of  detection, and tax rates. The relationship  between fines and tax compliance shows  inconsistent findings (Fischer et al.,  1992).  According to Alm and Gomez (2008)  research, there is a significant positive  relationship  between  taxpayers'  perceptions of the advantages of political  goods and their willingness to abide by  tax laws. Attitudes represent the positive\"),\n",

According  to Sardjono (2013), taxpayers' desire to  pay depends on their comprehension of  tax laws and their positive opinion of the  tax system's efficacy.     Zeng (2014) discovered that the most  significant  factor  influencing  the  participants' tax compliance behaviour  was the tax law system. A study's  findings indicate that a wide variety of  factors, including the personal traits of  taxpayers,  the  tax  system,  tax  administration, and the state of the  economy and politics, have an impact on  tax compliance. The main issues of  nontax compliance are taxpayers facing  high tax rates, citizens' tax attitude and  low tax morale, incorrect tax payment,  unsuitable public spending concerning  taxpayer preferences, disbelief in the  existence, noncompliance of taxpayers  due to unfriendly state-citizen relations,  poor structure of the tax system & tax  administration that doesn’t meet the  expectations & needs of taxpayers,  noncompliance of taxpayers due to  economic & political structures, low  level of governmental accountability and  transparency (Helhel & Ahmed, 2014).  Tax knowledge does not affect tax  compliance; therefore, efforts should be  made to raise taxpayer awareness to  increase  tax  compliance  and,  consequently, increase the amount of  money collected by the government  (Fauziati, et al., 2020). Tax complexity  and tax knowledge are considered to be  contributing factors to taxpayers' non- compliance behaviour (Saad, 2014).   One important factor that has been found  to influence tax compliance behavior is  the attitude of taxpayers. Numerous  economic  research  studies  have  demonstrated that tax compliance is  dependent on individual decisions about  paying taxes or evading them. These  studies have also confirmed that a large  number of potential determinants of  voluntary compliance, such as social  norms, equity and fairness, perceptions  of politics and the government, and  accountability towards tax compliance  attitude, can have an impact on an  individual's  income  or  profit  (Jayawardane, 2015). According to  Kamil (2015), a taxpayer's awareness,  knowledge, tax penalties, and tax  services have a big impact on how  compliant they  are  as  a  person.  According to Sinnasamy et al. (2015),  peer pressure controlled by tax agents,  tax rates, penalties, and tax fairness might  all lead to higher tax compliance in  Malaysia. In a study, Onu (2016)  examined the methods used to measure  attitudes in tax surveys and evaluated the  data that has been collected to date to  establish a connection between these  measures of attitude and real compliance.  The  study  makes  numerous  recommendations for enhancing the  specificity of attitude measurements,  using assessment scales, and reducing  social desirability biases to increase their  predictive usefulness. For the benefit of  academics preparing to perform survey  work, several guidelines are provided  about how to measure attitudes and  interpret attitude surveys. Additionally,  the results of taxpayer surveys may be  utilized to inform the creation and  management of tax laws.  According to Kiow (2017), public  governance and openness in government  operations have an impact on individuals'  ethical perceptions, which in turn have an  impact  on  their  tax  compliance  behaviour.

        "Explanation:\n",
        "This chain is composed of several components that process the input in a structured way. Here's a detailed look at each part:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. {\"context\": retriever, \"query\": RunnablePassthrough()}\n",
        "This is a dictionary where:\n",
        "\"context\": retriever: The retriever is used to fetch relevant documents or information based on a query. You have already set up the retriever to retrieve the top 5 similar documents (using search_kwargs={'k': 5}).\n",
        "\"query\": RunnablePassthrough(): This specifies that the query passed into the chain will be passed through unchanged, without any modifications or transformations. It's a placeholder in the chain that ensures the query can be inserted into the processing flow.\n",
        "Purpose: This combination allows the retriever to fetch context from your vector store, while the query itself remains unmodified as it passes through the RunnablePassthrough.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. | prompt:\n",
        "The | (pipe operator) connects components in LangChain, which allows you to define a processing pipeline.\n",
        "prompt refers to the ChatPromptTemplate or any other prompt configuration you've set up earlier. The prompt will use the context and query as inputs and structure the final input to the LLM.\n",
        "Purpose: This step formats the context and query into a structured prompt that will be used by the LLM. The prompt combines the retrieved context with the query to guide the LLM's response.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. | llm:\n",
        "llm is the Hugging Face model pipeline that you've set up using HuggingFacePipeline, which performs the actual text generation based on the formatted prompt.\n",
        "Purpose: The LLM (language model) takes the structured prompt and generates a response based on the context and query. It uses the underlying model (model_4bit in your case) to generate the most relevant or accurate output.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. | StrOutputParser():\n",
        "This is the output parser that ensures the output from the LLM is returned as a string. It takes whatever the LLM generates and converts it into a clean string format.\n",
        "Purpose: It ensures that the LLM's response, which could be in a more complex structure (e.g., a dictionary or list), is parsed and returned as a simple string that can be easily used or displayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Full Flow:\n",
        "Retriever: Fetches relevant documents based on the query.\n",
        "RunnablePassthrough: The original query passes through unchanged (could be used in later steps if necessary).\n",
        "Prompt: Combines the retrieved context and query into a structured input for the LLM.\n",
        "LLM: Generates a response based on the formatted prompt (context + query).\n",
        "StrOutputParser: Ensures the response is a clean string."
