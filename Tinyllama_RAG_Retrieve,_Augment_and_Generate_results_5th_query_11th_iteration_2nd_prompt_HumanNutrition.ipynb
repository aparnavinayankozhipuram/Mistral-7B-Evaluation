These  subgroups  are further  categorized  into mono-,  di-, and  polysacchari des.  indigestible carbohydrates provide a good amount of fiber with a  host of other health benefits.  Plants synthesize the fast-releasing carbohydrate, glucose, from  carbon dioxide in the air and water, and by harnessing the sun’s  energy. Recall that plants convert the energy in sunlight to chemical  energy in the molecule, glucose. Plants use glucose to make other  larger, more slow-releasing carbohydrates. When we eat plants we  harvest the energy of glucose to support life’s processes.  Figure 4.1 Carbohydrate Classification Scheme  Carbohydrates are a group of organic compounds containing a ratio  of one carbon atom to two hydrogen atoms to one oxygen atom.  Basically, they are hydrated carbons. The word “carbo” means  carbon and “hydrate” means water. Glucose, the most abundant  carbohydrate in the human body, has six carbon atoms, twelve  hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms. The chemical formula for  glucose is written as C6H12O6. Synonymous with the term  carbohydrate is the Greek word “saccharide,” which means sugar.  The simplest unit of a carbohydrate is a monosaccharide.  Carbohydrates are broadly classified into two subgroups, simple  (“fast-releasing”)  and  complex  (“slow-releasing”).  Simple  Introduction  |  231"

These  subgroups  are further  categorized  into mono-,  di-, and  polysacchari des.  indigestible carbohydrates provide a good amount of fiber with a  host of other health benefits.  Plants synthesize the fast-releasing carbohydrate, glucose, from  carbon dioxide in the air and water, and by harnessing the sun’s  energy. Recall that plants convert the energy in sunlight to chemical  energy in the molecule, glucose. Plants use glucose to make other  larger, more slow-releasing carbohydrates. When we eat plants we  harvest the energy of glucose to support life’s processes.  Figure 4.1 Carbohydrate Classification Scheme  Carbohydrates are a group of organic compounds containing a ratio  of one carbon atom to two hydrogen atoms to one oxygen atom.  Basically, they are hydrated carbons. The word “carbo” means  carbon and “hydrate” means water. Glucose, the most abundant  carbohydrate in the human body, has six carbon atoms, twelve  hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms. The chemical formula for  glucose is written as C6H12O6. Synonymous with the term  carbohydrate is the Greek word “saccharide,” which means sugar.  The simplest unit of a carbohydrate is a monosaccharide.  Carbohydrates are broadly classified into two subgroups, simple  (“fast-releasing”)  and  complex  (“slow-releasing”).  Simple  Introduction  |  231'),\n",

Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is  stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber  is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by  digestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes  through the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that  inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down.  One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of  energy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to  providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger  macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning  of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose  can be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage  molecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is  known as starch. Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates.  Lipids  Lipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen,  and oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water.  Lipids are found predominantly in butter, oils, meats, dairy  products, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods. The three  main  types  of  lipids  are  triglycerides  (triacylglycerols),  phospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or  store energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than  carbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four  kilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy  storage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes,  surround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide  insulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other  functions in the body.  6  |  Introduction'),\n",

Complex  carbohydrates  are  long  chains  of  monosaccharides.  Simple/Fast-Releasing Carbohydrates  Simple carbohydrates are also known more simply as “sugars” and  are  grouped  as  either  monosaccharides  or  disaccharides.  Monosaccharides include glucose, fructose, and galactose, and the  disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose.  Simple carbohydrates stimulate the sweetness taste sensation,  which is the most sensitive of all taste sensations. Even extremely  low concentrations of sugars in foods will stimulate the sweetness  taste  sensation.  Sweetness  varies  between  the  different  carbohydrate types—some are much sweeter than others. Fructose  is the top naturally-occurring sugar in sweetness value.  Monosaccharides  For all organisms from bacteria to plants to animals, glucose is the  preferred fuel source. The brain is completely dependent on glucose  as its energy source (except during extreme starvation conditions).  The monosaccharide galactose differs from glucose only in that a  hydroxyl (−OH) group faces in a different direction on the number  four carbon (Figure 4.2 “Structures of the Three Most Common  Monosaccharides: Glucose, Galactose, and Fructose”). This small  structural alteration causes galactose to be less stable than glucose.  As a result, the liver rapidly converts it to glucose.

There are  two main groups of polysaccharides: starches and fibers.  Starches  Starch molecules are found in abundance in grains, legumes, and  root vegetables, such as potatoes. Amylose, a plant starch, is a linear  chain containing hundreds of glucose units. Amylopectin, another  plant starch, is a branched chain containing thousands of glucose  units. These large starch molecules form crystals and are the  energy-storing molecules of plants. These two starch molecules  (amylose and amylopectin) are contained together in foods, but the  smaller one, amylose, is less abundant. Eating raw foods containing  starches provides very little energy as the digestive system has a  hard time breaking them down. Cooking breaks down the crystal  structure of starches, making them much easier to break down  in the human body. The starches that remain intact throughout  digestion are called resistant starches. Bacteria in the gut can break  some of these down and may benefit gastrointestinal health.  Isolated and modified starches are used widely in the food industry  and during cooking as food thickeners.  Figure 4.4 Structures of the Plant Starches and Glycogen  Introduction  |  235'),\n",

Simple carbohydrates are found in foods such as sugar, honey, white bread, and white rice, and are easy to digest and absorb into the bloodstream. They provide a quick source of energy, but also have potential health consequences due to their high glycemic index (GI) value, which can lead to spikes in blood sugar levels and potential negative effects on blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity.Complex carbohydrates:Complex carbohydrates, also known as polysaccharides, consist of multiple sugar molecules linked together in a chain or ring, such as cellulose or starch. Complex carbohydrates are found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes, and are digested and absorbed into the bloodstream slower than simple carbohydrates. They provide a more prolonged source of energy, but are also more complex and difficult to digest, and may have negative effects on blood sugar control, including the potential for glycogen spilling into the bloodstream, which can cause blood sugar levels to spike.In general, complex carbohydrates are generally healthier and more nutrient-dense than simple carbohydrates.
