There are three classes of macronutrients:  carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically  processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients  comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is  converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,  allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of  measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels  the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie  multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,  denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a  capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in  the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other  macronutrients, it does not yield calories.  Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen. The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk,  fruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables  also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates  are broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical  structure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and  complex carbohydrates.  Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples  of simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have  in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that  circulates in your blood.  Complex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars that can  be unbranched or branched. During digestion, the body breaks  Introduction  |  5'),\n",

Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two  hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60  percent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could  be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not  occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would  fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters  of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so  critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and  output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in  Chapter 4.  Micronutrients  Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser  amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions.  Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins.  There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See  Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2  “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their  major functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins,  micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist  in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e.,  coenzymes). Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions  in the body and are involved in all aspects of body functions from  producing  energy,  to  digesting  nutrients,  to  building  macromolecules. Micronutrients play many essential roles in the  body.  Table 1.1 Minerals and Their Major Functions  8  |  Introduction'),\n",

Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon,  oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include  meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a  Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt  description of these macronutrients; they are also known  colloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four  kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not  protein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to  bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the  chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate  that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist  within the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically  protein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different  amino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific  proteins.
